# Big Enough (*)
Write a small program that asks for the names and IDs of all employees in a small company, 
and store them in an array of integers and an array of Strings. (You will need to create
a Java class to hold the arrays, and to access them).
This is similar to the example from the notes, but you do not know the number of employees 
in advance. Read the names and IDs of employees until the user enters an empty name 
(i.e. length 0) or an ID equal to 0. Once you have finished reading employee data, go 
through the employee list and print the names and IDs of those employees whose ID is even 
or their names start with “S”. (Hint: As you do not know how many employees you need in 
advance, you will need a growing array. Create a small array, if it gets full create an 
array twice as big, copy all data to the new array, and discard the old array, etc).
