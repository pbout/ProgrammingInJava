# Checking Arrays
Create a new Java class called ArrayChecker with two methods:

- **isSymetrical(int[ ): ]** a method that returns true if the array of int provided as argument is symmetrical and
false otherwise.
- **reverse(int[ ): ]** a method that takes an array of int and returns another array of int of the same size and with
the same numbers, but in opposite order.

Write a Groovy script that creates an object of class ArrayChecker and uses its methods to check whether a
few arrays are symmetrical and, if they are not, reverses them.
