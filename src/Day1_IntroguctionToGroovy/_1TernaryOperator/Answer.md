## Answer:
 * int currentYear = 2012 sets the current year to 2012.
 * The **print** argument will display the string **When were you born (year)?**.
 * The **System.console().readLine()** will read the next user input.
 * **Integer.ParseInt** will convert the user entered string into an integer.
 * **ageAprox** is the result of the current year minus the birth year.
 * The string **result** will either be empty (if ageAprox is greater than 17) or contain "not" (if ageAprox < 17).
