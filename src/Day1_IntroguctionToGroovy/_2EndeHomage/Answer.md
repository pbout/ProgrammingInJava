## Answer
The variable ```i``` is initialized at a value greater than the minimum required to enter the while loop. 
If ```i``` is initialized with a value lower than 5 or the while loop compares to a value greater than 
the initial 10, the code will print a series of numbers from **i+1** by increments of **1** until the final value 
of the while loop (5).
