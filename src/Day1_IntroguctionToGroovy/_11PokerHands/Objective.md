#11. Poker hands (*)
Read five cards from the user. For each card, read the rank (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, 10,J,Q,K) 
and the suit (”spades”, ”hearts”, ”diamonds”, ”clubs”). Each of the five cards must be valid 
before accepting the next one. Once the program has the five cards, it should tell the user what 
is the best hand she has got, as per the following list (from best to worst):
* **Straigh flush**: all cards are of the same suite and their ranks are consecutive. 
Note that they are probably not ordered as they were entered.
* **Poker**: four of the five cards have the same rank.
* **Full House**: three of a kind plus two of a kind.
* **Flush**: all cards share the same suit, but are not consecutive.
* **Straight**: all cards are consecutive, but not of the same suit.
* **Three of a kind**: three of the five cards have the same rank.
* **Two pairs**: two pairs (see below).
* **Pair**: two of the five cards have the same rank.
* **Nothing**: any other situation.

If you ever launch an online poker business, this could be one (very small) piece of it.
