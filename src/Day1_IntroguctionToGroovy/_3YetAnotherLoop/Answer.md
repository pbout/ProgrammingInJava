## Answer
* The program starts by reading the users input and assigning it to variable ```str```.
* It then converts the users input into an integer ```i```.
* While users input < 10...
* increment ```i``` by 1
* Read users input again and convert it to an integer.
* if users input is 0 stop execution and print finished.
* if users input is anything other than 1 print user input.
* if users input is 1 print nothing and continue.
* once the ```i``` has incremented to 10 finish the loop and print ```finished```.
