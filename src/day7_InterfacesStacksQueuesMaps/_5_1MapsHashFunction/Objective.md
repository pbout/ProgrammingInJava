# 5.1 Hash function
Create a class HashUtilities that implements a simple hash function 
shortHash(int) that takes any integer and returns an integer between 
0 and 1000. You can use the modulo operator and the static function 
Math.abs(int) for obtaining the absolute value of an integer.

Note that shortHash(int) is a pure function (it does not have any 
side effects), so it should be static. Then you can call this method 
using the name of the class like ```HashUtilities.shortHash(int)```.

Every object in Java has the method hashCode(), that returns an int. 
Test your hash function by passing the hash codes of different 
objects and verifying that it always returns a number between 0 
and 1000, as in the following example:
```
    println "Give me a string and I will calculate its hash code";
    String str = System.console().readLine();
    int hash = str.hashCode();
    int smallHash = HashUtilities.shortHash(hash);
    System.out.println("0 < " + smallHash + " < 1000");
```
