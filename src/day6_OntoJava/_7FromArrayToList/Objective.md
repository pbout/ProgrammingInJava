# 7. From array to list

Create a _static_ method that takes an array of integers and returns a 
linked list of integers in the same order as the original array. 
You can put this method in a class called **ArrayUtilities** so that you 
can easily use it for the following exercises. 

(Note: This is what the method **Arrays.asList(...)** from the core Java 
library does (you can look  it up!). Class **Arrays** contains several 
static methods to operate with arrays. Before you can use this 
class properly, we need to learn about generic types (e.g. things 
that look like **\<T> List\<T>**) and we will do that soon.)
