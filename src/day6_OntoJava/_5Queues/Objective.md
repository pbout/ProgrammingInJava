# Queues (*)
A queue is a dynamic structure that implements these methods:
- **insert(...)** inserts an element at the beginning of the queue.
- **retrieve(...)** remove an element from the end of the queue.
- **size()** returns the current size of the queue.

Queues are heavily used in computing: communication buffers, incoming request to 
web servers, read/write requests to hard disks, etc.
Implement a queue of integers. This could represent requests to a hard drive to 
read from different sectors. Implement the three methods listed above.
Then write another class that creates a queue, and makes several **insert()**,
**retrieve()** , and **size()** calls.

Check that the values you get are consistent. The output of the program could 
look like this:

* There are 0 requests in the queue.
* Inserting request 5...
* Inserting request 8...
* Inserting request 12...
* There are 3 requests in the queue.
* Retrieving request 5... done.
* Inserting request 13...
* There are 3 requests in the queue.
* Retrieving request 8... done.
* Retrieving request 12... done.
* There are 2 requests in the queue.
* Retrieving request 13... done.
* etc...
