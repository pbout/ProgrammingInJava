# 13. QuickSort (**)
This is a popular sorting algorithm that is very fast in most 
situations. Once you have finished all the other exercises,
look up in wikipedia how this method works and make your own 
implementation (put it in ListUtilities.quickSort(List)).
Then compare its performance with the other two methods. In order 
to see significant differences, you will need to
use lists of some length.
