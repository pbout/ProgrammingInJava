Make a class that implements a method that reads a list of marks 
between 0 and 100 from the user, one per line,and stops when 
the user introduces a -1. The program should output at the end 
(and only at the end) how many marks there were in total, how 
many were distinctions (70–100), how many were passes (50–69), 
how many failed (0–49), and how many were invalid (e.g. 150 or -3).
**Use** _readLine()_ **exactly once**. The output may look similar
to this example:

* Input a mark: 13
* Input a mark: 45
* Input a mark: 63
* Input a mark: 73
* Input a mark: 101
* Input a mark: 45
* Input a mark: 18
* Input a mark: 92
* Input a mark: -1

There are 7 students: 2 distinctions, 1 pass, 4 fails 
(plus 1 invalid).
