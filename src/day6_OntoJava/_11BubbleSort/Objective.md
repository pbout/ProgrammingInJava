# 11. Bubble Sort
In this exercise, you will implement the bubble sort algorithm and 
use it to sort an unsorted linked list of integers. The bubble sort 
algorithm is the simplest sorting algorithm there is:

1. Take the first element. Compare it with the second element. 
If it is greater, make them change positions (first becomes second 
and viceversa); otherwise, do nothing.
2. Move to the next element. Repeat the process (i.e. compare 2 
and 3, then 3 and 4, up to the last element).
3. Now you have the highest element at the end of the list.
4. Move back to the beginning and repeat the whole process until 
your list is sorted.
5. Once you pass through the list without swapping elements, your 
list is sorted.

Put your implementation in a static method in a class, maybe 
ListUtilities.bubbleSort(List). The name of the algorithm comes 
from metaphorical bubbles always moving up in a liquid.

Try your method with different lists and see how long it takes to 
sort them. You can use the static method System.currentTimeMillis() 
to print on the screen the current time (measured in milliseconds 
since 1st January 1970).
