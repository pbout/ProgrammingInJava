#Circular lists
A circular list is a dynamic list in which there is a beginning but there is no end: 
the last element is pointing back to the first element. Circular lists can be 
singly - or doubly - linked. In this exercise, you must create a singly-linked
circular list using the “hospital and patients” example as a starting point.
- **Create the circular list** and **add several elements** to it (around 10
is fine).
- **Traverse it forwards for one complete loop**. While you go around the list, print 
out the content of each element. How do you know that you have reached the end of 
the list when you never find a null pointer?
- **Delete** a couple of elements from the list.
- **Traverse it again** printing out the content of each element.
- **Add a new element** to the list. Try to delete an element that is NOT in the list.
- **Traverse it again** printing out the content of each element.
