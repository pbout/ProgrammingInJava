# 10. A sorted List
Create a linked list of integers that is automatically sorted.

Everytime you add an element, make sure you introduce it at the 
right place in the queue so that the queue is always sorted from 
lower to higher numbers.

Create the list, insert several numbers into it (around 15 is fine) 
and then go through the list printing the value of each element. 
Check that the elements are correctly sorted.
