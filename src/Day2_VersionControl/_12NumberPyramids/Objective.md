#12. Number pyramids(*)

**a)** Write a program that outputs a number pyramid like the one below, going on forever 
(until you press Ctrl-C).
```
1
22
333
4444
55555
666666
7777777
...
```
(The formatting of the pyramid will mess up after a few numbers but that is OK for this exercise. 
If that bothers you, move on to the second and harder part of this exercise).

**b)** Write a program that reads a number between 1 and 25, and then outputs a number pyramid 
like the one below (the example is for number 8) with that number of levels. Notice that you must 
write the right number of spaces at each level so that the pyramid is properly aligned to the right.
```
              1
            2 2
          3 3 3
        4 4 4 4
      5 5 5 5 5
    6 6 6 6 6 6
  7 7 7 7 7 7 7
8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8
```
